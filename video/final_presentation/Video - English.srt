Terra satellite data.

4
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:53,056
Between 2001 and 2024, Guerrero

5
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:54,976
lost approximately

6
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:57,216
29660

7
00:00:57,216 --> 00:01:00,176
hectares of forest. This study analyzes

8
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,896
where and when that loss occurred and what

9
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,656
means for communities and

10
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:07,736
ecosystem services.

11
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,650
Our objectives were 3: number one,

12
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,570
quantify the magnitude and distribution

13
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,130
spatial scale of forest loss; number

14
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,010
2, relate the changes in NDVI

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,490
as a proxy for plant productivity; and

16
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,490
number 3, identify the hotspots

17
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,170
priority for restoration and

18
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,130
conservation.

19
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:45,736

thematic classification, matrices of

28

29

30

Main results, loss

33
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:41,369
accumulated in the State was

34
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,091
29,660 hectares.

1567 hectares, the

37
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:51,937
5.3%. Were observed

38
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:53,978
peaks in 2014 and

39
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:56,140
2024. Come in

40
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,062
2016 and 2024. Atoyac

41
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:01,864
explains 8.4% of the

42
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:04,426
state loss. 712

43
00:03:04,426 --> 00:03:07,348
570 equals 1282

44
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:10,150
hectares compared to 15,262

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,592
hectares in the State

46
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,434
They detected significant drops in the

47
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:18,276
NDVI in deforested areas,

48
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,758
which confirms a reduction in the

49
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,038
plant productivity.

50
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:59,216
Timelapse and mapping show

51
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:00,977
that deforestation is concentrated

52
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,219
mainly in northern municipalities and

53
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:05,941
northwest, while the large coast

54
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:08,102
retains more forest cover. The

55
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:10,384
pressure is associated with slopes already

56
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,266
areas near roads.

57
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:20,539
Losses are not random,

58
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,659
are linked to the expansion of livestock farming,

59
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,739
opening of roads and recurrent use of the

60
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:29,179
fire. The loss of forest

61
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,659
reduces ecosystem services,

62
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:34,539
water regulation, conservation of

63
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,099
soil and carbon sequestration. The

64
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,979
open satellite monitoring is key

65
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,419
to guide local actions.

66
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,511
We propose community reforestation

67
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:17,231
in critical basins, management

68
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:20,111
comprehensive fire management with local brigades,

69
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,911
protection of slopes, terraces and

70
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:24,911
living barriers, monitoring

71
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,791
participatory with Google Earth Engine

72
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:30,351
and territorial planning that limits the

73
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,271
expansion of pastures.

74
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,361
Open science plus community action,

75
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,081
path towards the restoration of the

76
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:40,371
ecosystems. Thank you.
